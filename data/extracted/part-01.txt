► Expressive Mono Sequencer Phrase
1. Ensure the synths are connected or for this example maybe connect
to a DAW on a Mac or PC using MIDI. Set 3 tracks with instruments.
Track 1 and 2 pulse / pluck style sounds and track 3 a bass pad. Each
of the following sequencers will connect to these DAW tracks. Hold
[Shift] + hold [Clear] each sequencer 1,2,3.
2. Set the project tempo. Hold [Shift] + turn (BPM) knob 1 to set to 120
beats per minute.
3. Select sequencer 1 and set to Mono mode. Tap Seq [1]. Hold [Shift] +
[1] to open the sequencer settings. Turn (Mode) to set the sequencer
to ‘MONO’. This is in page 1 of 3 for SEQ 1.
I. Set scale and root. While holding [Shift] + turn (Scal) knob 3 and
(Root) knob 4. Set to Minor C2. The octave range is set with (Oct)
knob 2.
II. Set the pattern length to 6 steps. Hold [End] + tap a pad in column
6. Alternatively knob 3 will change end step while holding [End].
The Frst step, set with [Init], should by default be 1.
III. Add 3 steps as follows: Step 1 to C2, Step 3 to F2 and Step 5 to
G2. To set these steps, columns represent steps, so use column
1,3 and 5. Rows represent the notes. The display shows the notes
when tapping a pad to set the step note. Pads assigned with
notes are lit.
IV. Hold Step 3 [Pad] + tap [Page] to select the accumulator page.
While holding Step 3 [Pad], turn knob 1 (Amt) and set to +1st.
Repeat for Step 5, setting the accumulator (Amt) to -1st.
V. Press [Play] to listen to the pattern created over the 6 step range.
4. Copy sequence 1 to sequencer 2. Hold [Copy] + tap Seq [1] then hold
[Paste] + tap Seq [2]. The sequencer will be copied. If this is
controlling a different track in the DAW it may need to change channel
to match the DAW track. Channel is set for the sequencer in its
settings, [Shift] + Seq [1], then turn (Ch) Knob 1.
2.2 A Simple Expressive Sequence.
While Mono is a simple sequencer mode on OXI ONE MKII it is still is packed with powerful features and is the
perfect starting point. Here we build an expressive and playable sequence and demonstrate how quick it can be to
get creative and be inspired by OXI ONE.

► Expressive Mono Sequencer Phrase (Continued)
5. Both sequencers play the same pattern. However pressing, [Perf] will
open the performance page. This allows each of the sequencers to be
transposed or rotated on the ?y allowing ad libs and performances to be
played out. Row 1 represents sequencer 1 and row 2, sequencer 2. The
central white column is the original state, i.e. no transposition. Press a
pad either side in these rows to transpose up or down.Hold [Shift] +
[Pad] in row 1 and 2 to rotate patterns. Try these out and experiment
with the performer while the sequencer plays.
6. Create a third mono mode seq on track 3. Follow the previous steps to
create and conFgure the sequencer as a mono mode sequencer. Add a
long note for C2, bottom row. Hold Step 1 + tap step 16 to assign a tied
note.This will represent a long bass pad and should be set to the
channel for this track in the DAW.
7. Lets add some variation with the ?ow button. Flow steps will only play
while the ?ow button is held. Set steps 4 and 6 to notes G#2 and A#2
respectively. To dd these notes hold [Flow] + tap [Pad]. This assigns the
steps as only ?ow steps. When playing the sequence, hold [Flow] to
trigger these steps or release to play without these steps being triggered.
8. Experiment once again in [Perf] mode to transpose sequencer patterns in
harmony.
9. Ensure the project is saved, hold [Shift] + tap [Save]. This will be a good
starting point from which to progress further.

► Building a Chord Pattern
1. Start from the previous project.
2. Select sequencer 4 and set to Chord mode. Tap Seq [4]. Hold [Shift] +
[4] to open the sequencer settings. Turn (Mode) to set the sequencer
to ‘CHRD’. This is in page 1 of 3 for SEQ 4.
3. Now to assemble some chords.
I. In the main sequencer view, set scale and root. Hold [Shift] + turn
(Scal) knob 3 and (Root) knob 4. Set to Minor C2. The octave
range is set with (Oct) knob 2.
II. Press [Keyboard] to open the scale pads and chord selector.
III. Column 13 & 14 will select chord types, column 15, voicing /
inversions and column 16 voice spread. The second top row in
the 16th column will selected between the chord banks.
IV. Audition the chords to Fnd the ones to save. To store a chord,
hold the pad keyboard for the chord and at the same time hold an
empty, top row pad 1-12 for a few seconds. The pad will illuminate
yellow when a chord is stored.
4. The stored chords can now be used to sequence a melody. To pick
and place a chord from sequencer view, hold [Keyboard] to show the
chord view page and tap a stored chord pad 1-12 top row. Release
the [Keyboard] button and tap any step pad to place the selected
chord on the grid. Repeat for other chords to build a melody.
5. Now consider adding more interest and variation with some repeats.
The OXI ONE repeat engine offers a wide range of options to add
repeats, spread their intervals, add ramps and more. Hold a chord
step [Pad] + tap [Page] to select the step submenu for the repetition
settings. While still holding the pad, turn knob 1 (Rept) to set
repetitions.
6. While still holding the step pad, try adjusting other parameters. Maybe
set the repetition spacing with knob 4 and adjust the ramps with knob
3. Experiment while playing the chords.
2.3 Chords, Repetitions and Harmonization.
Chord mode allows a melody of chords to be selected from a library of scales, chords and voicing available and
patterns to be build from these. Add ?ow steps to create variations and link the pattern to the previous project to
play all patterns in harmony.

7. An alternative control for repetitions is to press (Rept), knob 4 from the
main sequencer screen. This will open the pad column editor for repeats.
Tap [Pad] to add repeats and [Shift] + [Pad] will adjust repeat duration,
indicated by the red lit pads.
8. To use ?ow to trigger only selected step repetitions, hold the step to edit
[Pad] + tap knob 4. This switches focus to edit the lower Rept%
parameter in the step submenu. With the pad still held, turn knob 4 to set
Rept% to ‘Flow’. Now the repeats will only be applied when the [Flow]
button is held.
9. Let’s link the chord sequencer playback to the mono sequencers
playback in an harmonious way. First, select sequencer [1]. Set the scale
using [Shift] + (Scal) knob 3 to ‘HARMON S4’. This takes sequencer 1’s
harmonization lead from chord sequencer 4. Repeat for sequencer 2.
10. Press [Perf] mode and experiment by transposing sequencer patterns.
These will now play and transpose in harmony. The mono sequencers 1
& 2 will follow the harmonic lead of sequencer 4. Transposing the chord
sequencer in the performer grid will control the chord and mono
sequencers harmonization.
11. Ensure the project is saved, hold [Shift] + tap [Save]. A good habit to get
into for saving iterative development of the project.

► Building a Drum Pattern
1. Start from the previous project.
2. Select sequencer 5 and set to Multitrack mode. Tap Seq [5]. Hold
[Shift] + [5] to open the sequencer settings. Turn (Mode) to set the
sequencer to ‘MULT’. This is in page 1 of 3 for SEQ 5.
3. Destination instruments can be conFgured using one MIDI channel
per drum, for example kick on channel 5. However some instruments
will respond to a single channel when each note represents a drum
instrument. For example, Elektron Digitakt can be used with an
individual note for each track. Both can be used in OXI ONE with a
multitrack sequencer.
4. Setting up a multitrack track.
I. To open the track menu, hold Sequencer [5] + Press Column 1
[Pad] for the track to select. Alternatively, press [Track], then press
column 1 [Pad] to select a track.
II. Turn (Ch) knob 1 to set the MIDI channel. This is for the selected
track and not for the sequencer globally.
III. Hold [Shift] + tap [Keyboard] to set preview mode. Any sounds
triggered from the MIDI output will be audible.
IV. Turn (Ofs) knob 2 to select a note offset. This is the note that the
steps on the track will trigger and send to the MIDI channel. The
note should represent the destination instrument, example ‘C1’.
V. Repeat for all tracks to conFgure.
5. The behaviour when programming multitrack steps can be changed in
the [Shift] + [ConFg] > work?ow options. This depends on your
personal preference:
Track Select priority in multitrack.
• Yes: First tap of a step will select the track to edit, then
subsequent step taps will assign triggers to the chosen step.
• No: Trigger steps can be added immediately on any track when
tapping a pad.
2.4 Multitrack for Drums.
Multitrack mode allows each row to act an independent sequencer. Individual MIDI channels can be set per row. If
all sequencers were set to multitrack mode, OXI ONE would offer 64 tracks of sequencing. Lets create a drum
pattern using the multitrack sequencer.

5. Each track will represent a drum instrument, for example kick, snare,
hi hat etc. Program steps on each track to create a drum pattern.
Playing the track will help to test sequence options.
6. Each track is independent so lengths, time divisions and direction.
Also variations in the sound can also be applied. For example:-
• Tap (Vel) knob 1 when in the main page to control velocity of the
selected track using the grid pad column editor.
• Tap (Rept) knob 4 when in the main page to assign repeats to
each step of the selected track using the grid pad column editor.
• Tap (Gate) knob 3 and then turn to adjust all gate lengths for the
selected track.
• Hold [Shift] + press [Flow] to open the groove editor for the
selected track. Grooves can be also be applied per track.
7. An alternative drum programming feature is the drum generator. This
will automatically generate patterns for the Frst three tracks of a
multitrack sequencer.
I. The track layout will automatically generate a kick on track 1,
snare on track 2 and hats on track 3.
II. Hold [Random] + tap column 1 [Pad] for track 1, 2 and 3. This
changes the status to drum generator tracks. Pads will be light
bright blue when activated.
III. Set the track length to 32 steps. The drum generator is optimised
for this length. Press [32] then hold [End] + tap the last column
pad rows for the three tracks. Remember a multitrack can have
the length setting per track.
IV. Press [Play] to generate patterns for these tracks.
8. Try using [Perf] to manage the drum tracks on the ?y, using mutes
and the preset variations to play ad libs and improvisations.

► Instrument De8nitions
1. OXI ONE supports instrument deFnitions. What does this mean?
Several proFles are loaded onto the device using the OXI App which
act like MIDI presets. They provide the predeFned mapping between
the OXI ONE and the external device. This makes life easier where all
CC controls are pre-conFgured and can simply be loaded to a track.
2. As an example, create a ‘POLY’ track on say sequencer [6]. Follow
the previous guidance for MIDI and sequencer conFguration.
3. To assign an instrument deFnition to seq 6, open the sequencer setup
using [Shift] + Sequencer [6]. Tap [Page] button to choose page 3/3
4. Then turn (Instr) knob 3. The loaded deFnitions are listed. New
deFnitions can be added to the device from the app. As an example,
choose OXI Instruments Coral, a Eurorack effect module.
5. Connect OXI ONE to the Coral device, in this example using the USB
connection option.
6. Press [Mod] to view the mapped parameters for sequencer 6 and
Coral device.
► Modulation Lanes
1. Track 6, for this example will focus on modulating another device. In
this case OXI Coral is the destination. It is assumed audio will be
channelled through Coral, maybe as generated in one of the other
work?ow examples.
2. On sequencer 6, press [Mod]. This opens the modulation function with
8 individual modulation lanes available. Think of these as modulation
sequencers.
3. If an instrument deFnition has been used the destinations are pre-
mapped. If not [Shift] + [Mod] opens the modulation matrix settings.
2.5 Magic of Modulation Lanes
Modulation is a term that refers to the control of a parameter to add movement and variation. For example a
whammy bar on a guitar modulates the strings. In electronic music modulation is typically applied through
envelopes and low frequency oscillators. This example focusses on a unique feature in OXI ONE, modulation
lanes. These are track lanes dedicated to the modulation or external and internal parameters. Modulation is an
application and setup speciFc. Therefore this work?ow is only a general introduction to the principles of using
modulation lanes in OXI ONE.

4. In the mod page, the 4 knobs represent a lane. Tap and hold a knob
to turn the modulation lane on or off. Tap a knob to switch the focus
between the upper 1-4 and lower 5-8 lanes.
5. Turning a knob, when active, will adjust all the step modulation
amount simultaneously. This is the value sent to the destination
parameter from OXI ONE mod lane. Think of this as a set of steps,
each adjusting the parameter value as the sequencer plays. Good
examples are a Flter cutoff, amount of reverb applied or the overall
dry/wet mix of an effect.
6. With a mod lane selected, the pads can be tapped to assign a value
to each. Swiping across the pads to draw a modulation curve is
possible. The grid pads act as column editors.
7. To edit the modulation matrix for a speciFc lane, hold [Shift] + tap knob
of the modulation lane to edit. A set of options for the CC destination
as well as range settings are possible. Internal destinations can also
be applied.
8. Try setting loops or different time divisions. Also include more than
one mod lane to modulate other device parameters in the same
sequence but with independent shapes.
9. To get even more advanced with modulation routing, it is possible to
route and external input, say a CV control from a Eurorack device,
through OXI ONE and out to a MIDI destination. Experiment with
routings and controls in the [Shift] + [Mod] settings. This all depends
of course on your hardware conFgurations and setups.

Sequencer Basics
3
OXI ONE is a battery powered performance orientated sequencer, controller
and composition tool. Equally at home on the stage for live performances or in
the studio as a tool to help music production and sound design. ONE MKII is an
evolution from the original model, Focusing heavily on evolving the sequencers,
enhancing the work?ow and enhancing with new features. ONE has 8
sequencers, each can be set to one of 6 unique sequencer modes. Whether
creating basic bass lines, intricate melodies or composing drum beats the right
tools are in the ONE toolkit. The three most fundamental areas when working
with the sequencer are the user interface controls, the pad grid and the display
screen. Some controls are dynamic and change based on the context. For
example the 4 control rotary knobs will be assigned to parameters based on
what function is selected and will display values to re?ect these parameters.
The grid is an important interface for creating patterns but is also used for
editing parameters. The grid is multi purpose and will dynamically change its
function to suit the sequencer mode and function selected. This section
concentrates the basics of using the ONE sequencers. The content here is
Focused on the more generic views and commands than can be applied in most
sequencing environments. These are foundation topics that need to be
familiarised before moving to more advanced detail later. The unique intricacies
or speciFc details of an individual sequencing mode is covered later.

34 The OXI ONE MKII Manual
3.1 What is a Sequencer?
From the perspective of ONE, a sequencer manages, creates, and enables editing of tracks and patterns. The
sequencer is the operating environment when building patterns from steps and controls the general sequence
playback and performance behavior. Only one sequencer can be selected at a time for editing and building tracks.
There are six sequencer operating modes. Each mode offers a set of options and work?ow tools that aim to Ft the
speciFc creative context. For example, mono mode is ideal for monophonic melodic or bass melodies.
The output created in the sequencer is typically a track. A track is a series of patterns, step events, and parameter
settings laid out over a musical timeline that controls the output to an external device. Typically, each sequencer
will manage a track, although there are exceptions for multitrack and matriceal mode, where the sequencer modes
can manage eight and four tracks respectively. It is helpful to think of a track as an instrument, although technically
multiple instruments can be connected to a ONE output. It is a standard practice to have one track represent each
external instrument. For example, a poly synth controlled by a poly mode sequencer, a multitrack sequencer with a
kick drum, snare and hat using three tracks, and a bass synth in mono mode could be a simple conFguration.

3.3 Navigating the Sequencer & Step Parameters
The ONE sequencers have parameters that cover the steps, tracks and the sequencer
itself. Some parameters control the global values, affecting say, all steps, while others
focus on the individual function for example an individual step. These can be the same
parameter but with a change in how it is applied.
In order to understand the overall parameter structure here is an introduction to
navigating the available options. Some parameters and pages will be the same across
sequencer modes while some are unique to the speciFc sequencer mode and will be
detailed further in the mode description later.
Highest level of conFguration for the overall sequencer including the conFguration of its
operating mode such as mono, poly, chord etc. Generally represents multiple pages of
global sequencer settings including MIDI channel, output port, program / bank change,
instrument deFnitions, color and more.
General track oriented settings including playback direction, time division and navigation
through viewing the grid octave range. Most modes have one track but for modes such as
multi the track menu is important to manage the parameters for each of the 8 tracks.
Open the sequencer setup. Hold [Shift] + tap [1] - [8]. These are
mode dependant but in general consist of several pages of
parameters. Once the menu is open, selection can be changed to
another sequencer by pressing its button [1] - [8].
Open the track setup. Tap [Track] button.
If additional parameter pages exist, the [Page] button will ?ash.
Press [Page] to cycle through available pages.
Also use [Shift] + sequencer button to cycle its pages.

3.4 Transport Controls
Transport refers to the three play, stop and record controls. Be aware that these can be operated manually on the
panel or may be in?uenced by external control, for example an external clock. The descriptions here are based on
internal synchronization.
Note
The playback ‘reset’ option controls all sequencers. However, to reset individual sequencers, hold [Shift] + [Mute] + Sequencer [1] - [8] for the
sequencer to reset. The reset behavior relies on the punch-in quantization.
Play / Pause Button Behavior Access settings by [Shift] + [ConFg] > Performance
Setting Command Description
OFF - Default Play Button will start playback from the Frst step. Any other press of play is ignored.
Button ?ashes white and green
PAUSE Play / Pause Button will start playback. Another press of play will pause playback or restart
playback from the paused position. Button ?ashes green while paused.
RESET Play / Reset Button will start playback. Another press of the play button will reset playback of
the running sequencers to the start position once the punch-in quantization
interval is achieved. Punch in quantization is labelled as ‘In’ on page 2/3 of the
sequencer setup pages.
To play the sequencers, press [Play]. The sequencers will start playing typically
from the Frst step in the pattern unless conFgured differently. The play button
behavior can be reconFgured in the conFg > performance menu.
Recording options are based on capturing incoming MIDI data into the sequencers or for selecting step recording on the

The stop button will not only stop the sequencer but can also control the sequencer reset or synchronization.
The sequencer will display the status of the playback with the transport buttons but also with the white play head
cursor. This will show the current steps played as it travels in the playback direction. Given that the pattern may
extend beyond the 16 step default, follower option can be selected. This will automatically follow the playhead
across each page.
Note
When ONE is not set as the primary controller and with enabled in the conFg > MIDI settings, pressing the Play, Stop and Record buttons can output
a MIDI CC message on port A. These are Stop = CC 105, Play = CC 106 and Rec = CC 107.
To stop the sequencers, press [Stop]. The sequencers playhead will reset to the
Frst step. When play is pressed it will start from this position.
Double tap to clear all MIDI, for example if there are hanging notes.
To reset the sequencers while playing, hold [Shift] + press [Stop]. This follows
the same punch-in quantization behavior as described above for the play
button, although the play button conFguration setting is not relevant here.
Toggle follow function on or off by Holding [Shift] + tap [Track]. When on the
grid pages will change to follow the playhead. When off the pages will remain
static, as selected. This is useful if editing on the ?y. Display will show a ‘F’
symbol in the display header when on.
Clock Synchronization. With the sequencer stopped, the global clock
synchronization can be changed. Hold [Shift] + tap [Stop] to cycle through the
options of INT - Internal clock sync and external input options of USB, MIDI
Jack or Bluetooth or Clock input. The current setting is displayed and the last

3.5 Mute and Activation Behavior
The sequencer can be active, inactive, muted or unmuted. The behaviour of the mute button for this purpose can
be conFgured in the settings. An active / inactive sequencer refers to the entire sequencer transport. When
inactive, transport will be stopped, no steps triggered and hence is also muted as there is no output. Only an
active, unmuted sequencer will issue control and note signals over the MIDI channel and physical outputs. Muting
an active sequencer will still allow transport control but no control signals or notes are sent to the physical outputs.
Also check settings for other muting conFgurations.

mode where each track row can be muted / unmuting. This command is applied immediately when
pressing this button combination and does not adhere to the mute behavior described above.
The [Mute] button is used to control muting and activation of sequencers. This is usually held along
with the sequencer, step or track pads, however the mute button can be latched. Double tap [Mute]
to latch the mute button on or to unlatch it off. Any subsequent commands while latched on, i.e.
Tapping Seq [1] - [8] will operate as if the mute button is held.

3.6 Sequencing Steps
In most modes the programming of steps in a sequencer is performed by using the 16 x 8 grid pads. In some
modes and views the pads may also be used for applying parameter changes, however here we explain the
general process of programming steps on the grid. Note that the color scheme in view will depend on the
sequencer selected. Ensure the desired sequencer is selected for editing.
Grid represents 16 columns of steps and 8 rows of notes.
The view can be navigated by the page buttons and scrolling the octave ranges.

(2) Steps can also be tied across pages. To tie steps, keep hold [Pad] on the Frst page, press the [Page] for the end location. While
still holding the Frst step, press [Pad] for the end of the tie on the new page. Ties must be made on the same row and octave. The
tie setting is also available in the gate parameter values. When setting a tie using grid pads, ensure the pads are held / tapped in
the correct sequential order as stated in the command. Tapping a pad within a tie will split the tie and create a new step.
(3) When applying the reverse tie, ie. Last + Frst pad, the steps will be populated between the two pads. The behavior of these steps is
conFgured in the ConFg > Work?ow > Inverted TIE gesture Fills or Random setting. If set to ‘Random’, notes are populated as
random values. If set to ‘Fill’ the equivalent note value is populated as a Fll in each step. This option can also be set to ‘Off’.
(1) When a step is deactivated the parameters that have been applied will be cleared. This is default behavior. This can be changed in
the conFg > work?ow settings to remember the parameter changes for a step when deactivated and to restore them back if the step
is reactivated later. This is useful for preparing steps before making them active, especially when performing live.

3.7 Global Sequencer View Parameters
In sequencer view, a set of generic parameters that can be edited directly with the rotary encoder knobs. In
addition the grid column pads can be used as a parameter editor for each option that is selected. The primary
parameters can be adjusted globally for all steps or some can be edited at an individual step level when holding a
step pad. Secondary parameters mainly focus on global or sequencer settings.
The primary global setting will:-
• Set the parameter value when subsequently laying down individual steps.
• Adjust the value of any existing step values relative to their current value. If this is a multitrack, then all steps
on the selected track are affected. Individual step values can also be edited separately. Some other views and
sequencer modes may change the default functions of these controls.

The octave can be adjusted using the [Oct] knob. This is the base octave on the
grid for the selected sequencer and ranges from -2 to +7 based on the root
selected. Edit root by holding shift and turning knob 4, (Root). The octave value
of each step will be offset from this base octave.
The global values for velocity, gate and repeats are shown as a lower and upper
range. The values are based on the lowest and highest value from the steps
already placed on the grid. If no steps exist, the default is used for the upper and
lower value. When editing these global values the existing step values will
change relative to the adjustment made. The value range will compress when
adjusting at the upper and lower limits, also re?ected in each step value. For
example, the velocity upper limit is 127 and all steps will change to this value if
editing the global velocity to the maximum level.
(1) In a multitrack sequencer, tapping the octave knob will open the pitch editor.

Velocity VEL (Knob 1) 1 - 127
Default 75
Controls the trig envelope amplitude for the output affecting the CV
level. Global velocity sets a lower - upper range based on existing
step values to allow relative changes. Hold a step pad to edit the
individual step value. Tap for the step velocity grid column view to edit
the active velocity using the grid column pads for each step.
Octave OCT (Knob 2) -4 to +4
Default C2
The global octave assigns a base octave range (not the note) for the
sequencer grid notes. Individual step value can also be set as a
octave value offset up or down from this global base octave. Tap to
toggle the knob to control scroll navigation up/down the grid or to reset
back to the default view.
Gate GATE (Knob 3) 2 - 99, Tie
or Legato
Default 50%
Sets the duration of the note with respect to the sequencer note
division using the envelope decay time. The global option is set as
lower - upper percentage range based on any existing step values in
order to allow relative changes. Example, a 50% value for a note in a
1/16th division pattern will last for half the time division, giving a 1/32
note length. Tap for step gate view and to edit the active step gate
value using the grid column interface. Hold a step pad to edit an
individual step. Also applies a tie or legato setting.
Repeat REPT (Knob 4) 1 - 15
Default 1
Turn to adjust the lower - upper values for the repeat option. This will
activate a selected number of repeats at the note interval. This can be
set between 1-15 repeats. The grid pad column view also gives
access to the retrigger option. Retrigger can activate between 1-8
ratchets within the note duration.
Tempo BPM [Shift] + (Knob 1) 20 - 300
Default 80
Sets the global beats per minute for all sequencers. This is used as
the internal clock but internal tempo is not used if an external clock is
selected. Tap tempo can also be applied.
Swing SWNG [Shift] + (Knob 2) 10 - 90
Default 50
Swing introduces a more natural and slightly off grid feel to bring
interest to the rhythmic groove of a sequence. Increasing swing above
50 will push some notes slightly late and lowering the swing below 50
pulls some notes slightly early. Default of 50 means no swing is
applied. Each sequencer can have its own unique swing setting.
Scale SCAL [Shift] + (Knob 3) Options
Default
Chromatic
Selects a scale for the sequencer. A library is available from which to
choose. The behavior of the scale function is also dependant on the
scale quantization setting.
Root ROOT [Shift] + (Knob 4) C-2 to B7
Default C2
Selects a root note for the sequencer. This is typically represented by
the bottom row of the grid in most modes.
Note
The defaults for the velocity and gate setting are 75 and 50 respectively. These can be changed in the conFg > work?ow options.

3.8 Velocity
Velocity represents how hard an instrument's note is played. Think of the effort applied
when playing piano keys. Velocity is therefore considered modulation, and when
sequencing, notes can be set to a global value or step value between 1-127. This can be
applied to a destination instrument for example with MIDI to a synth or modulating
another target parameter with CV out to modular gear.
Velocity can be edited using the encoder knob 1 globally or on a per step basis. The grid
pad column editor can also be used to change the velocity values. Default function for the
knob is global velocity, turn to edit. For step velocity, hold a step and turn velocity and tap
the knob to open the respective pad column editor. Velocity affects the amplitude of the
attack / decay output envelope.

Changing global velocity will alter the range dynamically across all existing pads relatively or set a value
that will be used for placing subsequent steps where the lower velocity value in the range is used.
Placing new steps will apply the current lower global value for the step velocity. Any changes to the
global velocity will adjust all of the existing steps relatively. Editing the velocity for individual steps is also
possible while holding the chosen step.

3.9 Gate
Gate represents the duration that a note is played, controlled on a step basis or extending
across steps by tying a series of steps on the same row together. Legato creates a glide
between steps. When sequencing, gate can be set to a global value or step value
between 2-99. Consider the destination instrument settings in the overall note length for
example a synths on board envelopes.
Gate can be edited using the encoder knob 3 globally or on a per step basis. The grid
pad column editor can also be used to change the gate values. Default function for the

3.10 Repeat & Retrigger
The repeating of triggers during playback is a creative behavior option that can be applied in ONE and is controlled
in two ways. Repeat can be set at a global and step level. This will replicate the playback of a triggered note at a
deFned number of iterations across a step duration. Assigning the ‘skip’ option to an individual step will ignore the
step timing, shortening the sequence.
Retrigger is a variation on the repeat behavior typically controlled at global level to create a ratcheting effect over a
step interval. Retriggers can be transitioned to repeats in the extended step menu.

The ‘Rept’ parameter sets the amount of repeats that will be applied in the step period. This starts at a
maximum of 8 at x1 duration but expands up to 15 when the duration value is increased. The length of
the repeat chain can be extended over a duration covering multiple steps. This is set using the ‘Durat’
parameter with options ranging from x1 to x15 steps.
The option to change the repeat behavior is also possible by ramping up or down the velocity of the
repeats, set over a +/-70% range. Here less is more, so try smaller values Frst. In addition the repeat

3.11 Trigger Probability
Trigger probability, labelled ‘Trig’ in the step parameters, is only available at a per step level. Holding one or more
steps will allow the trig parameter to be edited using knob 4 for these steps. One trig condition is set per step. Trig
value is evaluated on each cycle of the sequencer, commencing from pressing play and then sets whether the
step will be triggered or not. The same model is applied for the repeats engine and any other probability functions.
Knob 4 will set the global repeat by default and revert to step triggers while holding one or more steps.
Trig can be assigned a probability % value which sets how likely it is for a step to
trigger or not. Default is 100% meaning a step will trigger on each sequence cycle as
normal and 0% will never trigger. Anything in-between will trigger in a random style
frequency based on the %. For example, 50% doesn't trigger predictably, once every
other cycle, but generally it will trigger 50% of the time on average.
The logical options offer a predictable application variation into a pattern when
triggering notes on sequencer count cycles. The A represents the number of the cycle
that will trigger the step. The count is reset after sequencer completes cycle number B.

Trigger on the 2nd cycle of a 4 count. Reset at the end of 4th cycle.
The pattern will trigger overall on every 2nd, 6th, 10th and so forth.
1:2
Trigger is active on Frst loop, not the second.
The count resets after the second loop and
this on/off trigger cycle pattern continues.
3:4
Trigger is active on third loop and the count
resets after the fourth. The pattern will trigger
overall on every 3rd, 7th, 11th etc.

NOTES
Sequencer Basics	3
Similar principles as the A:B model but follows a logical ‘not’
condition. The A represents the number of the cycle that will
NOT trigger the step. All other cycles will trigger the step. The
count is reset after sequencer completes cycle number B.
PRE activates this trig on the chosen step only when the nearest prior step condition is true. This check
refers to the previous, most recent trigger condition state and is not based purely on whether the prior step
itself is active or not but it depends on its trigger state. This step will not trigger if the prior trigger condition
is not met i.e. ‘false’. If set to ‘Not Pre’ i.e. PRE, the step will trigger if the prior trigger condition is ‘false’.

Examples:
Example: 2:4
Trigger on all cycles of a 4 count except the 2nd cycle. Reset at the end of
4th cycle. The pattern will trigger overall on every 1st, 3rd, 4th and so on.
1:2
Trigger is inactive on Frst loop, active
on the second. The count resets after
the second loop and this on/off trigger
cycle pattern continues.
3:4
Trigger is inactive on third loop and
the count resets after the fourth. The
pattern will effectively trigger overall
on every 1st, 2nd, 4th etc.
